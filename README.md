<h1>
  Adversarial reinforcement learning in playing video games for two players
</h1>
<p>
  The field of machine learning has been rapidly advancing in recent years. Part of it includes reinforcement learning, which is used to learn complex environments, such as games on the Atari 2600 gaming console simulation. The purpose of this thesis is to determine how successful two reinforcement learning agents manage to learn the game of Pong in an adversarial setup. With the help of the Python programming language and libraries PettingZoo and TensorFlow we implemented the deep reinforcement learning algorithm (DQN) without convolutional layers, because we gained insight into the game's memory and read input values from there. For the experimental part, we let two neural networks play the game Pong in an adversarial setup. We found that after a sufficient number of learning steps, the neural networks develop an offensive strategy that helps them score points. We presented the results in two ways: by measuring the length of each episode and by counting the hits of the ball for each agent in every episode.
